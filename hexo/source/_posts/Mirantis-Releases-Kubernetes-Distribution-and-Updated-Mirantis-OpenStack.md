Mirantis Cloud Platform 1.0 is a distribution of OpenStack and [Kubernetes](https://www.mirantis.com/software/kubernetes/?utm_campaign=k8s%20weight%20increasing) that can orchestrate VMs, Containers and Bare Metal

SUNNYVALE, CA – April 19, 2017 – [Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/), the managed open cloud company, today announced availability of a commercially-supported distribution of OpenStack and Kubernetes, delivered in a single, integrated package, and with a unique build-operate-transfer delivery model.

“Today, infrastructure consumption patterns are defined by the public cloud, where everything is API driven, managed and continuously delivered. Mirantis OpenStack, which featured Fuel as an installer, was the easiest OpenStack distribution to deploy, but every new version required a forklift upgrade,” said Boris Renski, Mirantis co-founder and CMO. “Mirantis Cloud Platform departs from the traditional installer-centric architecture and towards an operations-centric architecture, continuously delivered by either Mirantis or the customers’ DevOps team with zero downtime. Updates no longer happen once every 6-12 months, but are introduced in minor increments on a weekly basis. In the next five to ten years, all vendors in the space will either find a way to adapt to this pattern or they will disappear.”

Along with launching [Mirantis Cloud Platform](https://www.mirantis.com/mcp) (MCP) 1.0, Mirantis is also first to introduce a unique delivery model for the platform. Unlike traditional vendors that sell software subscriptions, Mirantis will onboard customers to MCP through a build-operate-transfer delivery model. The company will operate an open cloud platform for customers for a period of at least twelve months with up to four nines SLA prior to off boarding the operational burden to customer’s team, if desired. The delivery model ensures that not just the software, but also the customer’s team and process are aligned with DevOps best practices.

Unlike any other solution in the industry, customers onboarded to MCP have an option to completely transfer the platform under their own management. Everything in MCP is based on popular open standards with no lock-in, making it possible for customers to break ties with Mirantis and run the platform independently should they choose to do so.

“We are happy to see a growing number of vendors embrace Kubernetes and launch a commercially supported offering based on the technology,” said Allan Naim from the Kubernetes and Container Engine Product Team.

Mirantis also collaborated with Intel to drive upstream optimizations to the OpenStack platform to drive increased customer hardening and fully take advantage of Intel architecture capabilities. This joint development can now be used in MCP.

“Over the last two years, Intel has worked closely with Mirantis to optimize OpenStack to meet the requirements of large enterprise and comms service providers’ environments,” said Lisa Davis, vice president and general manager of Enterprise & Government IT Modernization, Intel Corporation Data Center Group. “Examples of our joint work include improved network, storage, and high availability capabilities as well as Kubernetes enhancements. Customers will now be able to take advantage of these optimizations with this release of the Mirantis Cloud Platform.”

“As the industry embraces composable, open infrastructure, the “LAMP stack of cloud” is emerging, made up of OpenStack, Kubernetes, and other key open technologies,” said Mark Collier, chief operating officer, OpenStack Foundation. “Mirantis Cloud Platform presents a new vision for the OpenStack distribution, one that embraces diverse compute, storage and networking technologies continuously rather than via major upgrades on six-month cycles.”

Specifically, Mirantis Cloud Platform 1.0 is:

- **Open Cloud Software** — providing a single platform to orchestrate VMs, containers and bare metal compute resources by:
  * Expanding Mirantis OpenStack to include Kubernetes for container orchestration.
  * Complementing the virtual compute stacks with best-in-class open source software defined networking (SDN), specifically Mirantis OpenContrail for VMs and bare metal, and Calico for containers.
  * Featuring Ceph, the most popular open source software defined storage (SDS), for both Kubernetes and OpenStack.
- **DriveTrain** — Mirantis DriveTrain sets the foundation for DevOps style lifecycle management of the open cloud software stack by enabling continuous integration, continuous testing and continuous delivery through a CI/ CD pipeline. DriveTrain enables:
  * Increased Day 1 flexibility to customize the reference architecture and configurations during initial software installation.
  * Greater ability to perform Day 2 operations such as post-deployment configuration, functionality and architecture changes.
  * Seamless version updates through an automated pipeline to a virtualized control plane to minimize downtime.
- **StackLight** — enables strict compliance to availability SLAs by providing continuous monitoring of the open cloud software stacks through a unified set of software services and dashboards.
  * StackLight avoids lock-in by including best-in-breed open source software for log management, metrics and alerts.
  * It includes a comprehensive DevOps portal that displays information such as StackLight visualization and DriveTrain configuration settings.
  * The entire Mirantis StackLight toolchain is purpose-built for MCP to enable up to 99.99% uptime service level agreements with Mirantis Managed OpenStack.

With the release of MCP, Mirantis is also announcing end-of-life for Mirantis OpenStack (MOS) and Fuel by September 2019. Mirantis will be working with all customers currently using MOS on a tailored transition plan from MOS to MCP.
